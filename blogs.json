While AR extends our grasp of the world (think virtually trying on clothes or virtually placing an entertainment unit in the layout of your living room), VR recreates or transcends the real world (like </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/10-haunting-tech-trends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokémon GO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But MR allows virtual and real-world content to blend in real time. (See </span><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft’s HoloLens</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example.) MR places digital content into a physical space by first scanning the real-world environment and mapping it in 3D. The possibilities, and the holograms, are endless.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20823\" src=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/wp-content/media/2018/02/MR-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" /></p>\n<h2><b>2: Blockchain and bitcoin</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like AR and VR, </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/blockchain-technology-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain and bitcoin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are not the same but they’re two digital peas in a digital pod. Back in 2008 when bitcoin was created as an unregulated digital currency, there needed to be a secure way to make transactions. Enter blockchain, a distributed ledger on a public, open peer-to-peer network. Today most things you can make a list of can benefit from blockchain technology, but it all began with bitcoin. (Quite the complex first love.)</span></p>\n<h2><b>3: Crowdsourced design and AI</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is another buzzy term that’s often misunderstood. And the reason crowdsourcing in particular is a good fit for AI-driven projects, and design projects in particular, is because optionality and innovation are essential for both good design and </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/act-on-your-ai-initiatives-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smarter use of AI</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, voice as a platform (</span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/5-ways-ai-is-revolutionizing-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">powered by AI</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) demands new methods of interaction — not traditional tapping and swiping. Just as businesses once migrated to mobile-first thinking, it’s time to use AI-first thinking. That involves getting more designers involved in the initial ideation phase. And through crowdsourcing, you get access to more designers and new ways of interacting with technologies designed specifically with AI in mind.</span></p>\n<h2><b>4: Geo-targeting and smart messaging</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As consumers with smartphones, GPS, NFC, and Bluetooth, we’re just begging to be tracked — some of which is to our advantage. If I walk into a certain store, I might get a push notification informing me of a discount from the retailer’s app. If I request a Lyft and my driver arrives at my designated pick-up spot, I’ll get an in-app message, a text message, etc.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20824\" src=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/wp-content/media/2018/02/push-notification-image-e1518549369693.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"505\" height=\"379\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While geo-targeting from social platforms like Facebook and Twitter enables companies to reach more relevant audiences, smarter businesses are also taking it upon themselves to gather location information from all of their mobile subscribers. That way they can send </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2018/01/30/why-geotargeting-isnt-just-a-strategy-for-local-businesses/#6a1681514e96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">geo-targeted offers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the right customers in the right regions, cities, and so forth. Even fast-food chains like Domino’s have already jumped on the geo-targeting bandwagon to further entice customers with location-specific offers; because nothing says </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">made for each other</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like pizza and a discount.</span></p>\n<h2><b>5: Robotics and healthcare</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s no shortage of incredible advancements being made with 3D-printed prosthetics and </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/techcrunch-disrupt-ny/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mind-controlled wearable technology</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But today we also have robots assisting in surgical procedures, like a </span><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/03/robot-ear-surgeon-drills-future-medicine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cochlear implant</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

I’m 28 years old and I studied Computer Science from Binus University. And I don’t belong to Team Apple, Team Dog, Team Nike, or Team Mercedes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/media/2018/02/04_01-Cover-kharm-1024x575.png\" alt=\"Meet kharm\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" /></p>\n<p><strong>You are our 2017 Topcoder Open design champion, but when you started you were competing on Algorithm track. Why did you switch and how was the journey from one track to another?</strong><br />\nI was a competitive programmer during High School/University. It was very common for us to train/have an account in Topcoder. But I discontinued after graduating, and then tried my hand at the Design track for several years afterwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Did/do you work as a developer or do you have your own Studio?</strong><br />\nI used to be a freelance full stack developer. When I worked in a team, I was flexible enough to work as both a designer and programmer, as and when it was required of me. So yeah, you can say I am multi-functional . As for having my own studio, I don’t have one, yet.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you find out about Topcoder? I see you joined in 2006.</strong><br />\nTopcoder is very popular in the Competitive Programming community. Honestly, I can’t even remember the first time I heard about TC.</p>\n<p><strong>You are one of the few designers who is rated in prototype (gray) and algorithm competitions (blue). How do you find the competitions in these tracks versus design?</strong><br />\nAlgorithm is the hardest one. Most of elite competitors are already International Rockstars since High School.</p>\n<p>UI Prototype is quite comparable with UI Design. It needs more discipline and endurance, whereas UI Design needs broader knowledge (imnsho) and creativity.</p>\n<p>Actually I only tried UI Prototype once and it didn’t go well. Haha! I changed the stylings (margin, font size, etc) to fit my own taste. My designer instincts told me to polish the storyboard. However, since it was a Prototype contest, being different with the storyboard actually got me a pretty bad scorecard. So I stick to UI Designing rather than improving my messy code. However, sometimes it’s tempting to improve my prototype rating.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you switch to design? Are you a self taught designer?</strong><br />\nAlgorithm can’t cover my living cost. And from the other tracks, design is the most suitable (and fun) one for me. Yes, I am self-taught.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the learning curve on Topcoder design challenges?</strong><br />\nI don’t think it’s hard. In fact, it is fun!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-20800\" src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/media/2018/02/04_02-Kharm-and-Other-Designers-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" /></p>\n<p><strong>What part did you find most difficult and how did you overcome it?</strong><br />\nI was beaten multiple times and didn’t have any clue how the winning designs looked like. My confidence was deteriorating, and I couldn’t see the distance between my solution and the winning one. It felt like I can’t reach my goal, no matter how hard I tried.</p>\n<p>The Design Newsletter section that show screenshots from some winning designs (and other contests that show the winning designs) helped me to regain my confidence. Even when I lost in the overall score in a challenge, I could see that I did better in some other part. It was not a complete loss and I could see myself actually having a chance at winning. My hopes were raise, and propelled me to keep moving.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have any advice for members from other tracks who want to become great designers?</strong><br />\nThe good thing to start on UI Design track is everyone might have an upper hand based on his/her unique experiences. If your Father is a farmer, most likely you will have a better understanding developing a concept for Farming Apps than others (and there are a lot of Design Concept Challenges on TC). From the UX perspective no one starts from scratch! We already learn about UX indirectly through our daily activities.</p>\n<p>So I think, you just need to learn how to pour your idea well into the screens. No need for fancy typography or illustration at first. Practically here is my suggestion to begin.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-requisite:</strong><br />\nSketch &amp; icons8<br />\n<strong>1 Learn Sketch</strong> &#8211; 4-8 hours Youtube video should be enough to cover the basic.<br />\n<strong>2 Recreate 1 screen daily for 1 month</strong> &#8211; Go to Dribbble, pick one screen (mobile/desktop/etc) with more than 200 likes. Recreate this in your spare time (should be around 30-90 minutes/screen).<br />\n<strong>3 Compete!</strong></p>\n<p>Once you get the basic, you may hone your skills one by one on each special topic like Typography, Grid System, Form Design, Data Visualisation, etc. Also, knowing more about specific topic made me appreciate the little things that I overlooked before.</p>\n<p>The last one is start early.. Your sense needs time to grow. Good luck :)!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/media/2017/03/DaraK.png\" alt=\"DaraK\" /></p>\n<h5>DaraK is an enthusiastic designer, is passionate about improving the customer’s online experience, likes to travel, and learn about other cultures.</h5>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/algorithm-and-going-to-design-champion-meet-kharm/\">Starting Off With Algorithm To Becoming Design Champion, Meet kharm!</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com\"></a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":{"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/algorithm-and-going-to-design-champion-meet-kharm/feed/"},"slash:comments":{"_text":"0"}},{"title":{"_text":"Single Round Match 726 Editorials"},"link":{"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/single-round-match-726-editorials/"},"comments":{"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/single-round-match-726-editorials/#respond"},"pubDate":{"_text":"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 07:08:14 +0000"},"dc:creator":{"_cdata":"Aditya"},"category":[{"_cdata":"Community Stories"},{"_cdata":"SRM"},{"_cdata":"SRM-Editorials"}],"guid":{"_attributes":{"isPermaLink":"false"},"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/?p=20796"},"description":{"_cdata":"<p>Some of the SRM 726 Editorials are now published.

But that&#8217;s not necessary.</p>\n<p>Notice that, for our string, we&#8217;re only interested in the characters that can appear in beginning of the string. For a character to appear in the beginning of a string, it must appear before every other character and its duplicate both appear. For example:</p>\n<p>abcddeeabc</p>\n<p>When we consider the above string, a, b, c, and d can all be characters that appear at the beginning of the string after we remove duplicates. The reason that &#8216;e&#8217; can&#8217;t be chosen is because &#8216;d&#8217; shows up twice before &#8216;e&#8217; does. That means no matter which &#8216;d&#8217; is removed, it will appear before any &#8216;e&#8217;s can show up.</p>\n<p>So now we know that to solve our problem, we just need to find which characters appear in the string before any other character has its duplicate show up. Then, we can choose the smallest character from that set as our answer.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, we&#8217;re going to make use of a frequency array. We create an array where each index represents a character. For example, index 0 represents &#8216;a&#8217;, index 1 represents &#8216;b&#8217;, and index 25 represents &#8216;z&#8217;. Inside of each of these indices will be a number that represents the number of times we see a particular character.</p>\n<p>For this problem, we&#8217;ll look at each character in the string, from left to right, updating our frequency array as we go, and once we find a frequency of 2 for any character, we know that we can only choose a letter from the letters we&#8217;ve visited before. We then check our frequency array for the letters we&#8217;ve seen to find which letter was the smallest, and return that as our answer.</p>\n<p>The time complexity for this solution is O(N) (specifically O(N/2 + 1) ), since at worst we have to check half of the letters in our string until we find the duplicate. The space complexity is O(1), since the only extra space we use is a frequency array to represent the count of 26 characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">\r\n#include&lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include&lt;string&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nclass StringHalving\r\n\t{\r\n    public:\r\n    string lexsmallest(string);\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nstring StringHalving::lexsmallest(string s)\r\n\t{\r\n    string answer = &quot;&quot;;\t// The string that we return.\r\n    \r\n\t// Create a frequency array for each character we see. \r\n\t// For example, 'a' = index 0, and if it shows up 3 times\r\n\t// then freq[0] = 3;\r\n    int freq[26] = {0}; // Initialize each index to 0.\r\n    \r\n\t// Go through each character in our string and mark our frequency array.\r\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++)\r\n        {\r\n    \tchar c = s[i];\r\n        freq[c-'a'] += 1;\r\n\t\t// If we find a duplicate (since the letter shows up twice now).

The i-th box has three values: <strong>a</strong>[i], <strong>b</strong>[i], and <strong>cost</strong>[i]. It means, to buy i-th box costs <strong>cost</strong>[i], and (number of red candies, number of blue candies) = (<strong>a</strong>[i], <strong>b</strong>[i]), (<strong>a</strong>[i]+1, <strong>b</strong>[i]–1), or (<strong>a</strong>[i]–1, <strong>b</strong>[i]+1) are possible. What is the minimum cost if you want to guarantee that you can get at least <strong>K</strong> candies of same color? If you cannot guarantee even if you buy any set of boxes, answer -1 instead. You can assume, 1 ≤<strong> N</strong> ≤ 50, and 1 ≤ <strong>a</strong>[i],<strong> b</strong>[i], <strong>K</strong> ≤ 10000.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution and Approach</strong><br />\nFirst, the problem seems complicated. So, let’s think about the following problem instead: “if you buy all boxes, can you guarantee that you can get at least <strong>K</strong> candies of same color?” Actually, it’s not so hard. You can guarantee that you can get at least <strong>K</strong> candies if and only if it satisfies one of the three following condition:<br />\n1. The sum of <strong>a</strong>[i]-1 is at least <strong>K</strong>.<br />\n2. The sum of <strong>b</strong>[i]-1 is at least <strong>K</strong>.<br />\n3. The sum of <strong>a</strong>[i]+<strong>b</strong>[i] is at least <strong>2K-1</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can prove easily if you take following process. First, take <strong>a</strong>[i]-1 red candies and <strong>b</strong>[i]-1 blue candies from each box. Now, there are 2 candies remaining in each box and any color configuration is possible. Then, take all the remaining <strong>2N</strong> candies to empty the boxes. Now, for any pair of non-negative integers (x, y) that satisfies x + y = 2N, “you took (sum of a[i]-1)+x red candies and (sum of b[i]-1)+y blue candies” is possible. If you solve the inequalities over the integers, 0≤x≤2N, (sum of a[i]-1)+x&lt;K, (sum of b[i]-1)+(2N-x)&lt;K simultaneously, the answer is “(the sum of a[i]-1)&lt;K and (the sum of b[i]-1)&lt;K and (the sum of a[i]+b[i])≤2K-2”. Therefore, you can guarantee that you can get at least <strong>K</strong> candies if and only if it satisfies one of the condition a, b, or c.</p>\n<p>Now the problem became simple. You can take the minimum value of “what is the minimal cost subset of boxes that the sum of a-1 is at least K?”, “what is the minimal cost subset of boxes that the sum of b-1 is at least K?”, and “what is the minimal cost subset of boxes that the sum of a+b is at least 2K-1?”. All three problem has the same form: “There are <strong>N</strong> non-negative integers v[0], v[1],…, v[N-1]. Selecting value v[i] costs c[i]. What is the minimum cost of taking integers so that sum of integers is at least <strong>K</strong>?” (let’s call this “sub-problem”).</p>\n<p>You can easily solve with knapsack-like dynamic programming.

I like how React is more split into self-contained components than Angular, it seems cleaner and easier to work on with multiple people doing different parts simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the most challenging thing you have to do as a Software Architect? How do you deal with it and also with everyday problems that come your way, in your role as an Architect ?</strong><br />\nProbably the balance of meeting or exceeding client expectations while helping community members to be successful. Sometimes I feel that there&#8217;s a disconnect, that members think the stuff we&#8217;re running is architected or designed completely by us Software Architects, but we have to work within the confines provided by the client.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your interests besides being a part of Topcoder? (hobbies or maybe other things you’re working at)</strong><br />\nMy wife and I run a bar trivia company called <a href=\"http://whattrivia.com\">WhatTrivia</a>. We&#8217;ve done it for the past 9 years and it&#8217;s continuing to grow in Connecticut. Along with that, I&#8217;ll always be looking for another band to play with.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you like the most about the Topcoder community?</strong><br />\nI love how you can ask for some work, and get members who are excited and engaged and go above and beyond the original ask. So many times I&#8217;ve gotten forum posts or emails suggesting a better approach for the client, or a more efficient way to do something without expecting anything in return. Members care about their work, and it&#8217;s impressive every time I see it.</p>\n<p><strong>Describe the optimal client type you like to engage with?</strong><br />\nI love dealing with Software Dev teams. Sometimes we work with Marketing or management and they&#8217;re not as engaged in the development aspect, they just like to see the beautiful designs from the community. As a developer, when I tell the client that I can help their teams be more innovative or multiply their productivity, and they see the result, it really shows the power of the crowd.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptocurrency seems to be a disruptive element in the digital exchange market nowadays. What do you envision the future for Topcoder and Cryptocurrency?</strong><br />\nI&#8217;m working with IBM and ConsenSys on their Blockchain initiatives within the community. I&#8217;m very interested in both Hyperledger and Ethereum and think that those applications across many different business verticals can definitely change the level of trust and effectiveness on the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>What is it like working with copilots and solving problems together? What are the best qualities you expect a copilot to have?</strong><br />\nCopilots are my saving grace. Their attention to detail helps me be just as effective with 4 clients as I could be with one. Shoutout to Birdofpreyru, Callmekatootie, Talesforce and Elkhawajah, they&#8217;re my go-to dev copilots and they make my job fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Assuming you would have to pick a different role within the community, which of these would you choose and why? A: Competitor; B: Copilot; C: Reviewer.</strong><br />\nJust given the nature of my day job, I haven’t been programming as much as of late&#8230; I would probably be a Competitor. My skills are a little rusty, so I&#8217;d spend a decent amount of time as an unrated member, just given the quality and speed of the members who have been submitting to my projects :/</p>\n<p><strong>If you could travel to visit 2 Topcoder members in their respective countries, who would they be and where?</strong><br />\nI&#8217;d travel to Nigeria to make sure that Akinwale isn&#8217;t late for anything&#8230; (TCO F2F Finals?) Then I&#8217;d actually like to go hang out with Mahestro in Venezuela, because I didn&#8217;t get to hang out enough with him at TCO this year. </p>\n<p><strong>Which of the emerging technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, The Internet of Things, Virtual Reality, Other) will cause the most disruption to businesses in the near future and how do you see them affecting Topcoder?</strong><br />\nI&#8217;m really trying to get a grasp on Blockchain. It&#8217;s difficult because it&#8217;s moving so incredibly fast. I&#8217;ve actually been doing Udemy courses and trying to learn as much as I can from IBM and ConsenSys because I really feel that it will not only produce a new, viable form of global currency, but I believe blockchain platforms such as Ethereum will invade all tech teams across all industries.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.topcoder.com/wp-content/media/2017/03/DaraK.png\" alt=\"DaraK\"></p>\n<h5>DaraK is an enthusiastic designer, is passionate about improving the customer’s online experience, likes to travel, and learn about other cultures.</h5>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/meet-jcori-james-cori/\">Getting to know Topcoder Admins: Meet jcori – James Cori!</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com\"></a>.</p>\n"},"wfw:commentRss":{"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/meet-jcori-james-cori/feed/"},"slash:comments":{"_text":"0"}},{"title":{"_text":"Compete in SRM 729: Win Tickets to Hello India ICPC Programming Bootcamp!"},"link":{"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/compete-srm-729-win-tickets-hello-india-programming-bootcamp/"},"comments":{"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/blog/compete-srm-729-win-tickets-hello-india-programming-bootcamp/#respond"},"pubDate":{"_text":"Fri, 02 Feb 2018 13:00:12 +0000"},"dc:creator":{"_cdata":"Harshit Mehta"},"category":[{"_cdata":"Community Stories"},{"_cdata":"Community"},{"_cdata":"SRM"}],"guid":{"_attributes":{"isPermaLink":"false"},"_text":"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/?p=20788"},"description":{"_cdata":"<p>Hello Competitive Programmers!

By and large, the pivotal role all these AI-powered robots play is that of companionship for humans. But whether AI can substitute or perhaps even replace human relations is still a raging debate. However, there’s no denying it — dependence on AI for online retail and commerce has increased greatly over the last few years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon’s connected smart devices pioneered this trend. Take, for instance, the Echo Look. Among other things, it takes hands-free, floor-length photos of customers’ clothing, giving Amazon a wide selection of their outfits — all accessible in the compatible mobile app. Additionally, the app shows similar clothes that customers can buy from Amazon.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-20782\" src=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/wp-content/media/2018/01/echo-look-image-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is just one of the many things that AI is doing and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do to transform the ecommerce space, which will eventually require little to no manual effort. Here are five of the most interesting ways in which AI is taking over the online retail space.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Voice assistants</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a recent Capgemini Digital Transformation Institute report, consumers are developing a strong preference for </span><a href=\"https://www.sogeti.com/explore/newsroom/voice-assistants-will-revolutionize-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interacting with companies via voice assistants</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twenty-four percent of the consumers surveyed said they would rather use a voice assistant than a website for shopping. In the next three years, this figure is thought to rise to 40%. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At present, AI is still largely used for streaming music and getting information quickly (two of the biggest uses for Google Assistant). In the near future, we will be able to ask our AI companions to shop for us using verbal commands. The Capgemini report also suggests that over the next few years, more and more people will use voice assistants to buy groceries, household items, and other products online — and even make banking transactions.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Personal shopping assistants</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot many people still prefer the walk-in experience because real-world assistants can help them choose a good outfit or find another size. Online shoppers can soon expect virtual assistants who will be as good — or perhaps better — than in-store assistants. The search bar, which is the backbone of most online shopping experiences, will be replaced by these AI-powered assistants. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Visual search tools</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July of last year, eBay added visual search functions to improve their customer experience, a feature which was already available with both Google and Amazon. eBay’s Image Search enables customers to replace words with images to find a suitable match when looking for something on eBay.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-20783\" src=\"https://wwwtc.wpengine.com/wp-content/media/2018/01/ebay-visual-image-search-1024x563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"563\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shoppers can simply take a new photo or use an existing one from their device’s photo gallery of an item they want and enter it using eBay’s Image Search. eBay then surfaces listings that are a close match or visually similar to the product. Similarly, Amazon’s mobile app allows shoppers to identify objects with their camera to conduct a visual search.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Mish-mash of in-store and online</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon Go is a great example of this hybrid shopping experience. The tagline “Just Walk Out Shopping” sure caught everyone’s attention in 2016. Amazon integrated a variety of AI (and other) technologies — such as machine learning, RFID, computer vision, and sensor fusion — for the Go stores. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brand-new Amazon Go store in Seattle is already making headlines with its </span><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/22/amazon-go-lines-form-seattle-try-checkout-free-shopping/1053592001/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">checkout-free shopping</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> model The only thing that you need to have with you is the Amazon Go app before you enter the store. Your Amazon account will be automatically charged for what you take from the 1,800 square-foot mini market. (Of course, there are still some glitches to work out, like </span><a href=\"https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/amazon-go-shoplifting-accident\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accidental shoplifting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)</span></p>\n<h2><b>Chatbots</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personalized chatbots are a great way to </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/chatbot-can-improve-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve a company’s customer experience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for many reasons: serving up relevant content, faster customer service, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automated</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> customer service — to name just a few. And today, Topcoder offers </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/what-can-you-do/cognitive-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cognitive chatbot solution</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> powered by an AI-driven contextual conversation service (using IBM Watson).
